A C++ implementation of a 3-dimensional Kalman Filter, Matrix class with implementation of addition, subtraction, scaling, transpose, co-factors, and inversion. 
The code also implements Lattitude Longitude and Altitude (LLA) to Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinates with conversions between the two coordinate systems.

Validation LLA data taken from plots on Google Earth are also included with a python script for stripping the LLA data from the .kml
